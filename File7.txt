I'm writing here too:

Color Haze - Inside 

Well, I can't help it if I don't feel so good
If I don't feel so good I can't help it
Well, I can't help it if I don't feel so good
If I don't feel so good I can't help it
If I had it my way, I'd be sittin' on the top of the world
But I can't help it

When the anger comes in him
There's no place for a man to hide
One day it comes

One day it comes in him
There's no place for a man to hide
To hide
Would you do anything in the world
To make him feel better inside?
Inside

I'm gonna sit back back here
Gonna watch this cloud roll by
Roll by
I'm gonna sit back back here
Gonna watch this cloud roll by
Good-bye
Next time you'll see me
Should be shinin' like the 4th of July
So high

But I can't help it if I don't feel so good
If I don't feel so good I can't help it
If I had it my way, I'd be sittin' on the top of the world
But I can't help it
